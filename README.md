# -Linear-Regression-on-Medical-Price-Dataset
implementing the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.
The code provided is for performing linear regression on the Medical Price Dataset. It first loads the dataset and performs exploratory data analysis, including data description, information, and checking for missing values. 
It then preprocesses the data by encoding categorical variables and creating new features.
The code visualizes the data using various plots, such as pairplots, boxplots, barplots, and heatmaps, to understand the relationships between variables.
Next, it splits the data into training and test sets and applies feature scaling using MinMaxScaler. Finally, it defines functions for performing linear regression, calculating coefficients, and visualizing predictions.
The code demonstrates how to use these functions on the dataset, including dropping irrelevant columns and converting categorical variables to numeric representations.
